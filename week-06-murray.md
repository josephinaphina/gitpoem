It seems that Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments turned out to be accurate. I know in my own home I don't have cable television and I haven't for years. I grew up watching tv from a cable box but by the time I turned 18 Netflix and Hulu were already successful streaming sites. My reasoning for streaming vs cable is based the cost and convenience. It's much more cost effective to pay for a couple streaming subscriptions compared paying almost one hundred dollars a month for cable tv. Additionally, browsing streaming sites is more user friendly and most streaming services personalize your homepage to things you may like based on what you usually watch. I think the only people I know that still have cable is my grandparents, but they have Netflix and Amazon Prime TV as well. 

I think that the virtual environments that the actors of the Mandolorian use is an interesting result of Murray's prediction. I don't think that she could have predicted this strategy entirely, but the combination of television and internet was spot on. I think that as television progressed, it became more of a relaxation or distraction tool for most people. There is also the presence of video games, which is essentially virtual reality with a plot. It seems to me that video games, especially video games in 2022 have fulfilled that desire for people.
