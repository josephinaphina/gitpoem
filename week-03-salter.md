# Chris Salter's Entangled Response

<p>There are many contemporary tools that can be used to create art that could be considered Gesamtkunstwerk, meaning “the total artwork”. Wagner describes this process as including “all phases of art and in doing so to … destroy each one, in favor of the total purpose of them all”. It seems that Wagner’s idea was that multimedia art was not to be looked at as combination of individual disciplines, but as a discipline of its own. My interpretation of contemporary Gesamtkunstwerk would be any form of multidisciplinary art. Websites are a contemporary space where many medias can be shared at once, creating a “total artwork”.</p>

<p>There are a few different examples I discovered in the Rhizome Anthology that I believe could qualify. While I didn’t find any works that embodied all medias, many of them incorporated a combination of different disciplines. Examples include: Mouchette by Martine Neddam, A Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st century by VNS Matrix, Love by Group Z, and My Boyfriend Came Back FromThe War. These works utilize photography, poetry, graphic design, and performance. The interactive aspect of these works reminds me much of the Futurist movements with the goal of blurring the line between audience and participants.</p>
