Questions:
1. Do all games have rules? Is it still a game if there are no rules?
2. Are there certain types of rules that will lead to a specific type experience or is it mostly up to the user?
3. Do games change culture?

Game experience is a collaborative effort between the designer and those who play it. One example Anna gives readers is Super Mario Bros, even a simple and overly popular game such as this fosters a different environment and experience for each player. Depending on the player each story will be played differently. Anna describes games as an audience interacting with a set of rules. She also points out the differences between digital games and film because she disagrees with their frequent comparison. She explains that digital games and film are quite different due to the fact that film tells a static story, while digital games allow the audience to have a say in the plot (within the set of rules of course). The interactivity of the game I believe breeds a much different culture than than previous digital entertainment with which you are just an observer. 

However, even though each player has their own unique experience, their experience is set in a specific set of rules. There are self aware games, meta games, role-playing games, etc. So while players have a choice, it's all within a boundary with a general experience in mind for players created by the designer. Additionally, not all games will be fun. Some "grown up games" are design with the purpose of helping teach something about dynamics and relationships. An example Anthropy gives of a grown-up game is Wrigstad's Gang Rape, in hopes of educating people in the seriousness of sexual assault. I would hope that this sort of game would change the mindset of anyone who plays it, which in turn would shift the culture and minset around assault.

It seems like games shift culture in small ways, but I think digital games have moreso created a culture of their own. In games like Dungeons and Dragons, character creation is a huge factor. Characters select their own Strength, Career, Race, IQ, Gender, Age, and etc.. Some games ask a series of moral questions before they assign the player their character. All of these choices and factors then place the characters into a specific group and inherintly creates a sense of culture and heritage in this figmentive world. While I can't say that digital games are changing culture with much impact, I think they undeniably creating a subculture of their own.
