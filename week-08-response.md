I found a few different methods of targeted advertising that I’ve experienced in my life. I have noticed that I recently been targeted by uber eats via push notification around dinner time and by promotions from stores via email in the morning. I’ve experienced google searching something and then being targeted for an ad for ADHD. I’ve also been targeted for the A/B testing that they do with credit cards via mail and other forms of paper advertisements. Now that I really think about it, it feels like I’m constantly being targeted as a consumer or voter.

I believe that the internet would be more useful and egalitarian without these methods. Obviously, in a capitalist and entrepreneurship-pushing society there’s an over saturation of businesses but that doesn’t make room for people to be targeted and exploited. I will utilize the coupons a company emails me from time to time, but I could also just go to their website and see if there is a sale happening if I feel like shopping. While they may be somewhat useful if you were going to buy something anyways, I don’t believe this is a positive aspect of our society. Targeting people as pregnant, having addictions, people with low income, low self-esteem, impatient, isolated, or “unable to see and plan well” is wrong and feels malicious.
We should be focusing more on buying from small businesses who don’t have the capital to purchase these sorts of ads and target people, their products are usually better quality and way more ethical.
