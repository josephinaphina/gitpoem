<b> WMD = Weapons of Math Destruction </b>

  The first example O’Neil gives of a Weapon of Math Destruction occurred in Washington when D.C.’s new mayor was trying to improve underperforming schools. He hired an education reformer to be the new chancellor of the school district. They blamed the teachers for lack of learning and tried to weed out under-performing educators through an evaluation system that got rid of unsatisfactory teachers and placed others where they would fit best. This program was called IMPACT and almost 300 teachers were fired over the next two years. With this program, feedback from parents and other school staff lost importance and all that mattered was a score on an evaluation. Through this program, a teacher who had received very positive feedback from parents and coworkers was fired based on her IMPACT score alone.

  This model and many like ignored crucial social factors such as human prejudice, misunderstanding, and bias that in turn punished already poor or oppressed in society while they make the rich richer. Their attempts to turn human behavior, potential, and performance into programs and algorithms proved to be extremely complicated to execute efficiently. The WMD’s “define their own reality and use it to justify their results” with is destructive and unfortunately very common. O’Neil goes on to highlight a not-so-toxic model of WMD, the statistical approach to baseball known as “Moneyball”. She explains that Moneyball is not as bad because they are transparent and open to the public, so people have some idea what they’re getting into when participating. However, Moneyball data is no different than other WMDs in the way that WMDs consistently lack data for the behaviors it’s most interested in.

  O’Neil goes further to say that a model is simply an abstract representation of a process (baseball games, a supply chain, movie theater attendance, etc.) and it can take place in our heads or in a computer program. Racism could be seen as an especially awful model that exists in human minds based on faulty and incomplete data reinforced by institutional inequities and polluted by confirmation bias. WMDs have also contributed to the idea of national standards which grow to create distorted and dystopian ideas of the economy. This lead to the ranking of colleges in the United States which in turn changed the way universities operate forever. Between 1985 and 2013, the cost of college education grew by over 500 percent trying to compete against one another for that higher rank. 

  Another kind of WMD O’Neil breaks down for readers are predictive crime models like PredPol, which assesses the history of crime locations and then creates “hot spots”. This strategy is arguably better than more racist crime models in the past that focused on individuals race and criminal past. But these models still contribute to perpetuating oppression in already impoverished neighborhoods. They place police in locations where they can choose whether or not to arrest someone for an insignificant crime even though no one called 911. This leads to higher arrests for petty or nuisance crimes. These small arrests then contribute to the data being collected and heightens crime rates even more in these areas. This leads to more arrests and hundreds of people in prison for victimless crimes. Overall, I agree with O’Neil and her comparison of these models to actual weapons of mass destruction. Many of these models encoded human prejudice, misunderstanding, and bias that punished the poor and oppressed in society while they make the rich richer.
