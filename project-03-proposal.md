For the non-linear narrative project I am proposing a game about my two cats, Pig and Disco. The player would get to pick their cat character from 3 different options, and then would follow Disco and Pig around throughout their day before their owner gets home. The two cats will lead the player around throughout different places in chicago like red hot ranch, the garfield park conservatory, the lincoln park zoo, the shedd aquarium, etc. I'd like a lot of it to be silly and fun with doodle style illustrations and pastel and earth tones.
