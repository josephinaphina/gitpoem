For my personal portfolio I would love for it to feel sort of like a scrap book or a tumblr page. I like the idea of having the homescreen be the video I created for project two with clickable symbols or images that take you to other works. I am a musician so I was also thinking about having some of my songs queued up to play in the background while people explore the page.  I think it would also be nice to have some sort of drop down menu where you can be taken to a page for each project as well. I want it to feel fun, colorful, but curated.
